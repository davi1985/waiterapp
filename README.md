## About

Waiter app is an application developed to assist with the order flow in a restaurant. Through it, waiters and those responsible for preparing the orders can have better analysis, preparation, and organization in the work environment.

The project features both a mobile and a web application that complement each other. The mobile app allows waiters to view the product menu and create customer orders, while the web version includes a dashboard divided into 3 production stages according to the order's preparation: waiting queue, in production, and completed.
